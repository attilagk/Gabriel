  abstract        = {Disorders of the brain can exhibit considerable epidemiological comorbidity and often share symptoms, provoking debate about their etiologic overlap. We quantified the genetic sharing of 25 brain disorders from genome-wide association studies of 265,218 patients and 784,643 control participants and assessed their relationship to 17 phenotypes from 1,191,588 individuals. Psychiatric disorders share common variant risk, whereas neurological disorders appear more distinct from one another and from the psychiatric disorders. We also identified significant sharing between disorders and a number of brain phenotypes, including cognitive measures. Further, we conducted simulations to explore how statistical power, diagnostic misclassification, and phenotypic heterogeneity affect genetic correlations. These results highlight the importance of common genetic variation as a risk factor for brain disorders and the value of heritability-based methods in understanding their etiology.},

  abstract        = {Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have revealed a large number of links between genome variation and complex disease. Among other benefits, it is expected that these insights will lead to new therapeutic strategies, particularly the identification of new drug targets. In this paper, we evaluate the power of GWAS studies to find drug targets by examining how many existing drug targets have been directly 'rediscovered' by this technique, and the extent to which GWAS results may be leveraged by network information to discover known and new drug targets. We find that only a very small fraction of drug targets are directly detected in the relevant GWAS studies. We investigate two possible explanations for this observation. First, we find evidence of negative selection acting on drug target genes as a consequence of strong coupling with the disease phenotype, so reducing the incidence of SNPs linked to the disease. Second, we find that GWAS genes are substantially longer on average than drug targets and than all genes, suggesting there is a length related bias in GWAS results. In spite of the low direct relationship between drug targets and GWAS reported genes, we found these two sets of genes are closely coupled in the human protein network. As a consequence, machine-learning methods are able to recover known drug targets based on network context and the set of GWAS reported genes for the same disease. We show the approach is potentially useful for identifying drug repurposing opportunities. Although GWA studies do not directly identify most existing drug targets, there are several reasons to expect that new targets will nevertheless be discovered using these data. Initial results on drug repurposing studies using network analysis are encouraging and suggest directions for future development.},

  abstract     = {Drug development is a very costly and lengthy process, while repositioned or repurposed drugs could be brought into clinical practice within a shorter time-frame and at a much reduced cost. Numerous computational approaches to drug repositioning have been developed, but methods utilizing genome-wide association studies (GWASs) data are less explored. The past decade has observed a massive growth in the amount of data from GWAS; the rich information contained in GWAS has great potential to guide drug repositioning or discovery. While multiple tools are available for finding the most relevant genes from GWAS hits, searching for top susceptibility genes is only one way to guide repositioning, which has its own limitations. Here we provide a comprehensive review of different computational approaches that employ GWAS data to guide drug repositioning. These methods include selecting top candidate genes from GWAS as drug targets, deducing drug candidates based on drug-drug and disease-disease similarities, searching for reversed expression profiles between drugs and diseases, pathway-based methods as well as approaches based on analysis of biological networks. Each method is illustrated with examples, and their respective strengths and limitations are discussed. We also discussed several areas for future research.},

Intuitively, one might expect disease-causing variants to cluster into key pathways that drive disease etiology. But for complex traits, association signals tend to be spread across most of the genome-including near many genes without an obvious connection to disease. We propose that gene regulatory networks are sufficiently interconnected such that all genes expressed in disease-relevant cells are liable to affect the functions of core disease-related genes and that most heritability can be explained by effects on genes outside core pathways. We refer to this hypothesis as an "omnigenic" model.},

  abstract = {Although dementia has been described in ancient texts over many centuries (e.g., "Be kind to your father, even if his mind fail him." - Old Testament: Sirach 3:12), our knowledge of its underlying causes is little more than a century old. Alzheimer published his now famous case study only 110 years ago, and our modern understanding of the disease that bears his name, and its neuropsychological consequences, really only began to accelerate in the 1980s. Since then we have witnessed an explosion of basic and translational research into the causes, characterizations, and possible treatments for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other dementias. We review this lineage of work beginning with Alzheimer's own writings and drawings, then jump to the modern era beginning in the 1970s and early 1980s and provide a sampling of neuropsychological and other contextual work from each ensuing decade. During the 1980s our field began its foundational studies of profiling the neuropsychological deficits associated with AD and its differentiation from other dementias (e.g., cortical vs. subcortical dementias). The 1990s continued these efforts and began to identify the specific cognitive mechanisms affected by various neuropathologic substrates. The 2000s ushered in a focus on the study of prodromal stages of neurodegenerative disease before the full-blown dementia syndrome (i.e., mild cognitive impairment). The current decade has seen the rise of imaging and other biomarkers to characterize preclinical disease before the development of significant cognitive decline. Finally, we suggest future directions and predictions for dementia-related research and potential therapeutic interventions. (JINS, 2017, 23, 818-831).},

  abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is highly heritable and recent studies have identified over 20 disease-associated genomic loci. Yet these only explain a small proportion of the genetic variance, indicating that undiscovered loci remain. Here, we performed a large genome-wide association study of clinically diagnosed AD and AD-by-proxy (71,880 cases, 383,378 controls). AD-by-proxy, based on parental diagnoses, showed strong genetic correlation with AD (r(g) = 0.81). Meta-analysis identified 29 risk loci, implicating 215 potential causative genes. Associated genes are strongly expressed in immune-related tissues and cell types (spleen, liver, and microglia). Gene-set analyses indicate biological mechanisms involved in lipid-related processes and degradation of amyloid precursor proteins. We show strong genetic correlations with multiple health-related outcomes, and Mendelian randomization results suggest a protective effect of cognitive ability on AD risk. These results are a step forward in identifying the genetic factors that contribute to AD risk and add novel insights into the neurobiology of AD.},

  abstract = {We identified rare coding variants associated with Alzheimer's disease in a three-stage case-control study of 85,133 subjects. In stage 1, we genotyped 34,174 samples using a whole-exome microarray. In stage 2, we tested associated variants (P < 1 × 10(-4)) in 35,962 independent samples using de novo genotyping and imputed genotypes. In stage 3, we used an additional 14,997 samples to test the most significant stage 2 associations (P < 5 × 10(-8)) using imputed genotypes. We observed three new genome-wide significant nonsynonymous variants associated with Alzheimer's disease: a protective variant in PLCG2 (rs72824905: p.Pro522Arg, P = 5.38 × 10(-10), odds ratio (OR) = 0.68, minor allele frequency (MAF)(cases) = 0.0059, MAF(controls) = 0.0093), a risk variant in ABI3 (rs616338: p.Ser209Phe, P = 4.56 × 10(-10), OR = 1.43, MAF(cases) = 0.011, MAF(controls) = 0.008), and a new genome-wide significant variant in TREM2 (rs143332484: p.Arg62His, P = 1.55 × 10(-14), OR = 1.67, MAF(cases) = 0.0143, MAF(controls) = 0.0089), a known susceptibility gene for Alzheimer's disease. These protein-altering changes are in genes highly expressed in microglia and highlight an immune-related protein-protein interaction network enriched for previously identified risk genes in Alzheimer's disease. These genetic findings provide additional evidence that the microglia-mediated innate immune response contributes directly to the development of Alzheimer's disease.},

  abstract = {Risk for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD), the most prevalent dementia, is partially driven by genetics. To identify LOAD risk loci, we performed a large genome-wide association meta-analysis of clinically diagnosed LOAD (94,437 individuals). We confirm 20 previous LOAD risk loci and identify five new genome-wide loci (IQCK, ACE, ADAM10, ADAMTS1, and WWOX), two of which (ADAM10, ACE) were identified in a recent genome-wide association (GWAS)-by-familial-proxy of Alzheimer's or dementia. Fine-mapping of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region confirms the neurological and immune-mediated disease haplotype HLA-DR15 as a risk factor for LOAD. Pathway analysis implicates immunity, lipid metabolism, tau binding proteins, and amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism, showing that genetic variants affecting APP and Aβ processing are associated not only with early-onset autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease but also with LOAD. Analyses of risk genes and pathways show enrichment for rare variants (P = 1.32 × 10(-7)), indicating that additional rare variants remain to be identified. We also identify important genetic correlations between LOAD and traits such as family history of dementia and education.},

Here we used quantitative mass spectrometry and coexpression network analysis to conduct the largest proteomic study thus far on AD. A protein network module linked to sugar metabolism emerged as one of the modules most significantly associated with AD pathology and cognitive impairment. This module was enriched in AD genetic risk factors and in microglia and astrocyte protein markers associated with an anti-inflammatory state, suggesting that the biological functions it represents serve a protective role in AD. Proteins from this module were elevated in cerebrospinal fluid in early stages of the disease. In this study of >2,000 brains and nearly 400 cerebrospinal fluid samples by quantitative proteomics, we identify proteins and biological processes in AD brains that may serve as therapeutic targets and fluid biomarkers for the disease.},

  abstract     = {The absence of disease-modifying therapeutics for Alzheimer{\textquoteright}s disease (AD) continues, and an understanding of early, easily accessible biomarkers to inform treatment strategies remains elusive. This study uses knowledge of blood metabolites previously associated with midlife cognition{\textemdash}a preclinical predictor of AD{\textemdash}to systematically investigate causal associations with later AD status. Given that the pathological changes underlying AD are thought to develop years before clinical manifestations of the disease, developing these findings further could hold special utility in informing early treatment intervention.There are currently no disease-modifying treatments for Alzheimer{\textquoteright}s disease (AD), and an understanding of preclinical causal biomarkers to help target disease pathogenesis in the earliest phases remains elusive. Here, we investigated whether 19 metabolites previously associated with midlife cognition{\textemdash}a preclinical predictor of AD{\textemdash}translate to later clinical risk, using Mendelian randomization (MR) to tease out AD-specific causal relationships. Summary statistics from the largest genome-wide association studies (GWASs) for AD and metabolites were used to perform bidirectional univariable MR. Bayesian model averaging (BMA) was additionally performed to address high correlation between metabolites and identify metabolite combinations that may be on the AD causal pathway. Univariable MR indicated four extra-large high-density lipoproteins (XL.HDL) on the causal pathway to AD: free cholesterol (XL.HDL.FC: 95\% CI = 0.78 to 0.94), total lipids (XL.HDL.L: 95\% CI = 0.80 to 0.97), phospholipids (XL.HDL.PL: 95\% CI = 0.81 to 0.97), and concentration of XL.HDL particles (95\% CI = 0.79 to 0.96), significant at an adjusted P \&lt; 0.009. MR{\textendash}BMA corroborated XL.HDL.FC to be among the top three causal metabolites, in addition to total cholesterol in XL.HDL (XL.HDL.C) and glycoprotein acetyls (GP). Both XL.HDL.C and GP demonstrated suggestive univariable evidence of causality (P \&lt; 0.05), and GP successfully replicated within an independent dataset. This study offers insight into the causal relationship between metabolites demonstrating association with midlife cognition and AD. It highlights GP in addition to several XL.HDLs{\textemdash}particularly XL.HDL.FC{\textemdash}as causal candidates warranting further investigation. As AD pathology is thought to develop decades prior to symptom onset, expanding on these findings could inform risk reduction strategies.Metabolite data used within primary analyses are publicly available within the MR-Base catalog (https://www.mrbase.org/). AD GWAS data used within primary analyses are publicly available for download at https://www.niagads.org/datasets/ng00075. Metabolite and genomic data used within post hoc analyses can be found in the ADNI database (http://adni.loni.usc.edu).},

  abstract  = {Observational epidemiological studies are prone to confounding, reverse causation and various biases and have generated findings that have proved to be unreliable indicators of the causal effects of modifiable exposures on disease outcomes. Mendelian randomization (MR) is a method that utilizes genetic variants that are robustly associated with such modifiable exposures to generate more reliable evidence regarding which interventions should produce health benefits. The approach is being widely applied, and various ways to strengthen inference given the known potential limitations of MR are now available. Developments of MR, including two-sample MR, bidirectional MR, network MR, two-step MR, factorial MR and multiphenotype MR, are outlined in this review. The integration of genetic information into population-based epidemiological studies presents translational opportunities, which capitalize on the investment in genomic discovery research.},

Schizophrenia's strongest genetic association at a population level involves variation in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) locus, but the genes and molecular mechanisms accounting for this have been challenging to identify. Here we show that this association arises in part from many structurally diverse alleles of the complement component 4 (C4) genes. We found that these alleles generated widely varying levels of C4A and C4B expression in the brain, with each common C4 allele associating with schizophrenia in proportion to its tendency to generate greater expression of C4A. Human C4 protein localized to neuronal synapses, dendrites, axons, and cell bodies. In mice, C4 mediated synapse elimination during postnatal development. These results implicate excessive complement activity in the development of schizophrenia and may help explain the reduced numbers of synapses in the brains of individuals with schizophrenia.},

Clinically relevant associations of variants in genes encoding drug targets model the effect of modifying the same targets pharmacologically. To delineate drug development (including repurposing) opportunities arising from this paradigm, we connected complex disease- and biomarker-associated loci from genome-wide association studies to an updated set of genes encoding druggable human proteins, to agents with bioactivity against these targets, and, where there were licensed drugs, to clinical indications. We used this set of genes to inform the design of a new genotyping array, which will enable association studies of druggable genes for drug target selection and validation in human disease.},

We propose a method (called SMR) that integrates summary-level data from GWAS with data from expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) studies to identify genes whose expression levels are associated with a complex trait because of pleiotropy. We apply the method to five human complex traits using GWAS data on up to 339,224 individuals and eQTL data on 5,311 individuals, and we prioritize 126 genes (for example, TRAF1 and ANKRD55 for rheumatoid arthritis and SNX19 and NMRAL1 for schizophrenia), of which 25 genes are new candidates; 77 genes are not the nearest annotated gene to the top associated GWAS SNP. These genes provide important leads to design future functional studies to understand the mechanism whereby DNA variation leads to complex trait variation.},

  abstract = {Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have recently been employed as an approach that can draw upon the advantages of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and gene expression studies to identify genes associated with complex traits. Unlike standard GWAS, summary level data suffices for TWAS and offers improved statistical power. Two popular TWAS methods include either (a) imputing the cis genetic component of gene expression from smaller sized studies (using multi-SNP prediction or MP) into much larger effective sample sizes afforded by GWAS - TWAS-MP or (b) using summary-based Mendelian randomization - TWAS-SMR. Although these methods have been effective at detecting functional variants, it remains unclear how extensive variability in the genetic architecture of complex traits and diseases impacts TWAS results. Our goal was to investigate the different scenarios under which these methods yielded enough power to detect significant expression-trait associations. In this study, we conducted extensive simulations based on 6000 randomly chosen, unrelated Caucasian males from Geisinger's MyCode population to compare the power to detect cis expression-trait associations (within 500 kb of a gene) using the above-described approaches. To test TWAS across varying genetic backgrounds we simulated gene expression and phenotype using different quantitative trait loci per gene and cis-expression /trait heritability under genetic models that differentiate the effect of causality from that of pleiotropy. For each gene, on a training set ranging from 100 to 1000 individuals, we either (a) estimated regression coefficients with gene expression as the response using five different methods: LASSO, elastic net, Bayesian LASSO, Bayesian spike-slab, and Bayesian ridge regression or (b) performed eQTL analysis. We then sampled with replacement 50,000, 150,000, and 300,000 individuals respectively from the testing set of the remaining 5000 individuals and conducted GWAS on each set. Subsequently, we integrated the GWAS summary statistics derived from the testing set with the weights (or eQTLs) derived from the training set to identify expression-trait associations using (a) TWAS-MP (b) TWAS-SMR (c) eQTL-based GWAS, or (d) standalone GWAS. Finally, we examined the power to detect functionally relevant genes using the different approaches under the considered simulation scenarios. In general, we observed great similarities among TWAS-MP methods although the Bayesian methods resulted in improved power in comparison to LASSO and elastic net as the trait architecture grew more complex while training sample sizes and expression heritability remained small. Finally, we observed high power under causality but very low to moderate power under pleiotropy.},

It often remains unclear whether the risk factors are cause or consequence of disease, or whether the associations are the result of confounding. We develop and apply a method (called GSMR) that performs a multi-SNP Mendelian randomization analysis using summary-level data from genome-wide association studies to test the causal associations of BMI, waist-to-hip ratio, serum cholesterols, blood pressures, height, and years of schooling (EduYears) with common diseases (sample sizes of up to 405,072). We identify a number of causal associations including a protective effect of LDL-cholesterol against type-2 diabetes (T2D) that might explain the side effects of statins on T2D, a protective effect of EduYears against Alzheimer’s disease, and bidirectional associations with opposite effects (e.g., higher BMI increases the risk of T2D but the effect of T2D on BMI is negative).},

We identified 341 loci (at a false discovery rate of 10%) associated with multiple traits. Several loci are associated with multiple phenotypes; for example, a nonsynonymous variant in the zinc transporter SLC39A8 influences seven of the traits, including risk of schizophrenia (rs13107325: log-transformed odds ratio (log OR) = 0.15, P = 2 × 10(-12)) and Parkinson disease (log OR = -0.15, P = 1.6 × 10(-7)), among others. Second, we used these loci to identify traits that have multiple genetic causes in common. For example, variants associated with increased risk of schizophrenia also tended to be associated with increased risk of inflammatory bowel disease. Finally, we developed a method to identify pairs of traits that show evidence of a causal relationship. For example, we show evidence that increased body mass index causally increases triglyceride levels.},

Yet, given the incompleteness of the interactome and the limited knowledge of disease-associated genes, it is not obvious if the available data have sufficient coverage to map out modules associated with each disease. Here we derive mathematical conditions for the identifiability of disease modules and show that the network-based location of each disease module determines its pathobiological relationship to other diseases. For example, diseases with overlapping network modules show significant coexpression patterns, symptom similarity, and comorbidity, whereas diseases residing in separated network neighborhoods are phenotypically distinct. These tools represent an interactome-based platform to predict molecular commonalities between phenotypically related diseases, even if they do not share primary disease genes.},

  abstract  = {Author summary Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been tremendously successful in identifying genetic variants that impact complex diseases. However, the roles of such studies in disease etiology remain poorly understood, primarily because a large proportion of the GWAS findings are located in the non-coding region of the genome. Recent advancements in high-throughput sequencing technology enable the systematic investigation of molecular quantitative trait loci (QTLs), which are genetic variants that directly affect molecular phenotypes (e.g., gene expression, transcription factor binding and DNA methylation). Linking molecular QTLs to GWAS findings intuitively represents an important step for interpreting the biological and clinical relevance of the GWAS results. In this paper, we describe a rigorous and efficient computational approach that assesses the enrichment and overlap between the GWAS findings and molecular QTLs. Importantly, we illustrate that the accurate quantification of overlapping between molecular QTL and GWAS signals requires reliable enrichment estimation. Our proposed approach fully accounts for the intrinsic uncertainty embedded in the association analyses of GWAS and molecular QTL mapping, and it outperforms the existing state-of-the-art approaches. Applying the proposed approach to the GWAS data of blood lipid traits and the whole blood expression QTLs (eQTLs) yields some novel biological insights and also illustrates the potential limitations of the currently available molecular QTL data.},

We apply this framework to 44 GTEx tissues and 100+ phenotypes from GWAS and meta-analysis studies, creating a growing public catalog of associations that seeks to capture the effects of gene expression variation on human phenotypes. Replication in an independent cohort is shown. Most of the associations are tissue specific, suggesting context specificity of the trait etiology. Colocalized significant associations in unexpected tissues underscore the need for an agnostic scanning of multiple contexts to improve our ability to detect causal regulatory mechanisms. Monogenic disease genes are enriched among significant associations for related traits, suggesting that smaller alterations of these genes may cause a spectrum of milder phenotypes.},

  abstract = {Alzheimer's disease is a pervasive neurodegenerative disorder, the molecular complexity of which remains poorly understood. Here, we analysed 80,660 single-nucleus transcriptomes from the prefrontal cortex of 48 individuals with varying degrees of Alzheimer's disease pathology. Across six major brain cell types, we identified transcriptionally distinct subpopulations, including those associated with pathology and characterized by regulators of myelination, inflammation, and neuron survival. The strongest disease-associated changes appeared early in pathological progression and were highly cell-type specific, whereas genes upregulated at late stages were common across cell types and primarily involved in the global stress response. Notably, we found that female cells were overrepresented in disease-associated subpopulations, and that transcriptional responses were substantially different between sexes in several cell types, including oligodendrocytes. Overall, myelination-related processes were recurrently perturbed in multiple cell types, suggesting that myelination has a key role in Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology. Our single-cell transcriptomic resource provides a blueprint for interrogating the molecular and cellular basis of Alzheimer's disease.},

  abstract  = {INTRODUCTION: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified multiple independent genetic loci that harbour variants associated with Alzheimer's disease, but the exact causal genes and biological pathways are largely unknown. METHODS: To prioritise likely causal genes associated with Alzheimer's disease, we used S-PrediXcan to integrate expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) study and CommonMind Consortium (CMC) with Alzheimer's disease GWAS summary statistics. We meta-analysed the GTEx results using S-MultiXcan, prioritised disease-implicated loci using a computational fine-mapping approach, and performed a biological pathway analysis on the gene-based results. RESULTS: We identified 126 tissue-specific gene-based associations across 48 GTEx tissues, targeting 50 unique genes. Meta-analysis of the tissue-specific associations identified 73 genes whose expression was associated with Alzheimer's disease. Additional analyses in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex from the CMC identified 12 significant associations, 8 of which also had a significant association in GTEx tissues. Fine-mapping of causal gene sets prioritised gene candidates in 10 Alzheimer's disease loci with strong evidence for causality. Biological pathway analyses of the meta-analysed GTEx data and CMC data identified a significant enrichment of Alzheimer's disease association signals in plasma lipoprotein clearance, in addition to multiple immune-related pathways. CONCLUSIONS: Gene expression data from brain and peripheral tissues can improve power to detect regulatory variation underlying Alzheimer's disease. However, the associations in peripheral tissues may reflect tissue-shared regulatory variation for a gene. Therefore, future functional studies should be performed to validate the biological meaning of these associations and whether they represent new pathogenic tissues.},

We select four network-predicted associations to test their causal relationship using large healthcare databases with over 220 million patients and state-of-the-art pharmacoepidemiologic analyses. Using propensity score matching, two of four network-based predictions are validated in patient-level data: carbamazepine is associated with an increased risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) [hazard ratio (HR) 1.56, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.12-2.18], and hydroxychloroquine is associated with a decreased risk of CAD (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.59-0.97). In vitro experiments show that hydroxychloroquine attenuates pro-inflammatory cytokine-mediated activation in human aortic endothelial cells, supporting mechanistically its potential beneficial effect in CAD. In summary, we demonstrate that a unique integration of protein-protein interaction network proximity and large-scale patient-level longitudinal data complemented by mechanistic in vitro studies can facilitate drug repurposing.},

  abstract  = {Discovering drugs that efficiently treat brain diseases has been challenging. Genetic variants that modulate the expression of potential drug targets can be utilized to assess the efficacy of therapeutic interventions. We therefore employed Mendelian Randomization (MR) on gene expression measured in brain tissue to identify drug targets involved in neurological and psychiatric diseases. We conducted a two-sample MR using cis-acting brain-derived expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) from the Accelerating Medicines Partnership for Alzheimer's Disease consortium (AMP-AD) and the CommonMind Consortium (CMC) meta-analysis study (n = 1,286) as genetic instruments to predict the effects of 7,137 genes on 12 neurological and psychiatric disorders. We conducted Bayesian colocalization analysis on the top MR findings (using P<6x10-7 as evidence threshold, Bonferroni-corrected for 80,557 MR tests) to confirm sharing of the same causal variants between gene expression and trait in each genomic region. We then intersected the colocalized genes with known monogenic disease genes recorded in Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) and with genes annotated as drug targets in the Open Targets platform to identify promising drug targets. 80 eQTLs showed MR evidence of a causal effect, from which we prioritised 47 genes based on colocalization with the trait. We causally linked the expression of 23 genes with schizophrenia and a single gene each with anorexia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder within the psychiatric diseases and 9 genes with Alzheimer's disease, 6 genes with Parkinson's disease, 4 genes with multiple sclerosis and two genes with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis within the neurological diseases we tested. From these we identified five genes (ACE, GPNMB, KCNQ5, RERE and SUOX) as attractive drug targets that may warrant follow-up in functional studies and clinical trials, demonstrating the value of this study design for discovering drug targets in neuropsychiatric diseases.},

Evidence from clinical and molecular studies suggest that chronic diseases, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, depression, and inflammatory bowel disease, may be associated with an increased risk of AD in different populations. Disruption in several shared biological pathways has been proposed as the underlying mechanism for the association between AD and these comorbidities. Notably, inflammation is a common dysregulated pathway shared by most of the comorbidities associated with AD. Some drugs commonly prescribed to patients with diabetes and cardiovascular disease have shown promising results in AD patients. Systems-based biology studies have identified common genetic factors and dysregulated pathways that may explain the relationship of comorbid disorders in AD. Nonetheless, the precise mechanisms for the occurrence of disease comorbidities in AD are not entirely understood. Here, we discuss the impact of the most common comorbidities in the clinical management of AD patients.},

Here, we take advantage of our increasing understanding of the network-based origins of diseases to introduce a drug-disease proximity measure that quantifies the interplay between drugs targets and diseases. By correcting for the known biases of the interactome, proximity helps us uncover the therapeutic effect of drugs, as well as to distinguish palliative from effective treatments. Our analysis of 238 drugs used in 78 diseases indicates that the therapeutic effect of drugs is localized in a small network neighborhood of the disease genes and highlights efficacy issues for drugs used in Parkinson and several inflammatory disorders. Finally, network-based proximity allows us to predict novel drug-disease associations that offer unprecedented opportunities for drug repurposing and the detection of adverse effects.},

We show that this approach is able to extract half of all manually curated associations with a false positive rate of only 0.16%. Nonetheless, text mining should not stand alone, but be combined with other types of evidence. For this reason, we have developed the DISEASES resource, which integrates the results from text mining with manually curated disease-gene associations, cancer mutation data, and genome-wide association studies from existing databases.

The disease has an estimated prevalence of 10-30% in the population >65 years of age with an incidence of 1-3%. Most patients with Alzheimer's disease (>95%) have the sporadic form, which is characterized by a late onset (80-90 years of age), and is the consequence of the failure to clear the amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide from the interstices of the brain. A large number of genetic risk factors for sporadic disease have been identified. A small proportion of patients (<1%) have inherited mutations in genes that affect processing of Aβ and develop the disease at a much younger age (mean age of ∼45 years). Detection of the accumulation of Aβ is now possible in preclinical and prodromal phases using cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers and PET. Several approved drugs ameliorate some of the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease, but no current interventions can modify the underlying disease mechanisms. Management is focused on the support of the social networks surrounding the patient and the treatment of any co-morbid illnesses, such as cerebrovascular disease.},

To identify LOAD risk loci, we performed a large genome-wide association meta-analysis of clinically diagnosed LOAD (94,437 individuals). We confirm 20 previous LOAD risk loci and identify five new genome-wide loci (IQCK, ACE, ADAM10, ADAMTS1, and WWOX), two of which (ADAM10, ACE) were identified in a recent genome-wide association (GWAS)-by-familial-proxy of Alzheimer's or dementia. Fine-mapping of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region confirms the neurological and immune-mediated disease haplotype HLA-DR15 as a risk factor for LOAD. Pathway analysis implicates immunity, lipid metabolism, tau binding proteins, and amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism, showing that genetic variants affecting APP and Aβ processing are associated not only with early-onset autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease but also with LOAD. Analyses of risk genes and pathways show enrichment for rare variants (P = 1.32 × 10(-7)), indicating that additional rare variants remain to be identified. We also identify important genetic correlations between LOAD and traits such as family history of dementia and education.},

  abstract               = {Drug combinations, offering increased therapeutic efficacy and reduced toxicity, play an important role in treating multiple complex diseases. Yet, our ability to identify and validate effective combinations is limited by a combinatorial explosion, driven by both the large number of drug pairs as well as dosage combinations. Here we propose a network-based methodology to identify clinically efficacious drug combinations for specific diseases. By quantifying the network-based relationship between drug targets and disease proteins in the human protein-protein interactome, we show the existence of six distinct classes of drug-drug-disease combinations. Relying on approved drug combinations for hypertension and cancer, we find that only one of the six classes correlates with therapeutic effects: if the targets of the drugs both hit disease module, but target separate neighborhoods. This finding allows us to identify and validate antihypertensive combinations, offering a generic, powerful network methodology to identify efficacious combination therapies in drug development.},

The emerging tools of network medicine offer a platform to explore systematically not only the molecular complexity of a particular disease, leading to the identification of disease modules and pathways, but also the molecular relationships among apparently distinct (patho)phenotypes. Advances in this direction are essential for identifying new disease genes, for uncovering the biological significance of disease-associated mutations identified by genome-wide association studies and full-genome sequencing, and for identifying drug targets and biomarkers for complex diseases.},

  abstract  = {Increase in global population and growing disease burden due to the emergence of infectious diseases (Zika virus), multidrug-resistant pathogens, drug-resistant cancers (cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer) and chronic diseases (arterial hypertension) necessitate effective therapies to improve health outcomes. However, the rapid increase in drug development cost demands innovative and sustainable drug discovery approaches. Drug repositioning, the discovery of new or improved therapies by reevaluation of approved or investigational compounds, solves a significant gap in the public health setting and improves the productivity of drug development. As the number of drug repurposing investigations increases, a new opportunity has emerged to understand factors driving drug repositioning through systematic analyses of drugs, drug targets and associated disease indications. However, such analyses have so far been hampered by the lack of a centralized knowledgebase, benchmarking data sets and reporting standards. To address these knowledge and clinical needs, here, we present RepurposeDB, a collection of repurposed drugs, drug targets and diseases, which was assembled, indexed and annotated from public data. RepurposeDB combines information on 253 drugs [small molecules (74.30%) and protein drugs (25.29%)] and 1125 diseases. Using RepurposeDB data, we identified pharmacological (chemical descriptors, physicochemical features and absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity properties), biological (protein domains, functional process, molecular mechanisms and pathway cross talks) and epidemiological (shared genetic architectures, disease comorbidities and clinical phenotype similarities) factors mediating drug repositioning. Collectively, RepurposeDB is developed as the reference database for drug repositioning investigations. The pharmacological, biological and epidemiological principles of drug repositioning identified from the meta-analyses could augment therapeutic development.},

Using three SNP-level fine-mapping methods, we identified 21 SNPs with >50% probability each of being causally involved in AD risk and others strongly suggested by functional annotation. We followed this with colocalization analyses across 109 gene expression quantitative trait loci datasets and prioritization of genes by using protein interaction networks and tissue-specific expression. Combining this information into a quantitative score, we found that evidence converged on likely causal genes, including the above four genes, and those at previously discovered AD loci, including BIN1, APH1B, PTK2B, PILRA and CASS4.},

To that end, we integrated AD GWAS results with human brain proteomes to perform a proteome-wide association study (PWAS) of AD, followed by Mendelian randomization and colocalization analysis. We identified 11 genes that are consistent with being causal in AD, acting via their cis-regulated brain protein abundance. Nine replicated in a confirmation PWAS and eight represent new AD risk genes not identified before by AD GWAS. Furthermore, we demonstrated that our results were independent of APOE e4. Together, our findings provide new insights into AD pathogenesis and promising targets for further mechanistic and therapeutic studies.},

  abstract  = {BACKGROUND: Evidence concerning the potential repurposing of antihypertensives for Alzheimer's disease prevention is inconclusive. We used Mendelian randomization, which can be more robust to confounding by indication and patient characteristics, to investigate the effects of lowering systolic blood pressure, via the protein targets of different antihypertensive drug classes, on Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: We used summary statistics from genome-wide association studies of systolic blood pressure and Alzheimer's disease in a two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis. We identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that mimic the action of antihypertensive protein targets and estimated the effect of lowering systolic blood pressure on Alzheimer's disease in three ways: (i) combining the protein targets of antihypertensive drug classes, (ii) combining all protein targets and (iii) without consideration of the protein targets. RESULTS: There was limited evidence that lowering systolic blood pressure, via the protein targets of antihypertensive drug classes, affected Alzheimer's disease risk. For example, the protein targets of calcium channel blockers had an odds ratio (OR) per 10 mmHg lower systolic blood pressure of 1.53 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.94 to 2.49; p = 0.09; SNPs = 17]. We also found limited evidence for an effect when combining all protein targets (OR per 10 mmHg lower systolic blood pressure: 1.14; 95% CI: 0.83 to 1.56; p = 0.41; SNPs = 59) and without consideration of the protein targets (OR per 10 mmHg lower systolic blood pressure: 1.04; 95% CI: 0.95 to 1.13; p = 0.45; SNPs = 153). CONCLUSIONS: Mendelian randomization suggests that lowering systolic blood pressure via the protein targets of antihypertensive drugs is unlikely to affect the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. Consequently, if specific antihypertensive drug classes do affect the risk of Alzheimer's disease, they may not do so via systolic blood pressure.},

  abstract = {The evident genetic, pathological and clinical heterogeneity of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) poses challenges for traditional drug development. We conducted a computational drug-repurposing screen for drugs to treat apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4)-related AD. We first established APOE genotype-dependent transcriptomic signatures of AD by analyzing publicly available human brain databases. We then queried these signatures against the Connectivity Map database, which contains transcriptomic perturbations of more than 1,300 drugs, to identify those that best reverse APOE genotype-specific AD signatures. Bumetanide was identified as a top drug for APOE4-related AD. Treatment of APOE4-knock-in mice without or with amyloid β (Aβ) accumulation using bumetanide rescued electrophysiological, pathological or cognitive deficits. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing revealed transcriptomic reversal of AD signatures in specific cell types in these mice, a finding confirmed in APOE4 induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons. In humans, bumetanide exposure was associated with a significantly lower AD prevalence in individuals over the age of 65 years in two electronic health record databases, suggesting the effectiveness of bumetanide in preventing AD.},

  abstract = {The apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) variant is the single greatest genetic risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer's disease (sAD). However, the cell-type-specific functions of APOE4 in relation to AD pathology remain understudied. Here, we utilize CRISPR/Cas9 and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to examine APOE4 effects on human brain cell types. Transcriptional profiling identified hundreds of differentially expressed genes in each cell type, with the most affected involving synaptic function (neurons), lipid metabolism (astrocytes), and immune response (microglia-like cells). APOE4 neurons exhibited increased synapse number and elevated Aβ(42) secretion relative to isogenic APOE3 cells while APOE4 astrocytes displayed impaired Aβ uptake and cholesterol accumulation. Notably, APOE4 microglia-like cells exhibited altered morphologies, which correlated with reduced Aβ phagocytosis. Consistently, converting APOE4 to APOE3 in brain cell types from sAD iPSCs was sufficient to attenuate multiple AD-related pathologies. Our study establishes a reference for human cell-type-specific changes associated with the APOE4 variant. VIDEO ABSTRACT.},

  abstract = {The role of brain cholesterol metabolism in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) remains unclear. Peripheral and brain cholesterol levels are largely independent due to the impermeability of the blood brain barrier (BBB), highlighting the importance of studying the role of brain cholesterol homeostasis in AD. We first tested whether metabolite markers of brain cholesterol biosynthesis and catabolism were altered in AD and associated with AD pathology using linear mixed-effects models in two brain autopsy samples from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) and the Religious Orders Study (ROS). We next tested whether genetic regulators of brain cholesterol biosynthesis and catabolism were altered in AD using the ANOVA test in publicly available brain tissue transcriptomic datasets. Finally, using regional brain transcriptomic data, we performed genome-scale metabolic network modeling to assess alterations in cholesterol biosynthesis and catabolism reactions in AD. We show that AD is associated with pervasive abnormalities in cholesterol biosynthesis and catabolism. Using transcriptomic data from Parkinson’s disease (PD) brain tissue samples, we found that gene expression alterations identified in AD were not observed in PD, suggesting that these changes may be specific to AD. Our results suggest that reduced de novo cholesterol biosynthesis may occur in response to impaired enzymatic cholesterol catabolism and efflux to maintain brain cholesterol levels in AD. This is accompanied by the accumulation of nonenzymatically generated cytotoxic oxysterols. Our results set the stage for experimental studies to address whether abnormalities in cholesterol metabolism are plausible therapeutic targets in AD.},

This study highlights microglia, immune cells and protein catabolism as relevant to late-onset Alzheimer's disease, while identifying and prioritizing previously unidentified genes of potential interest.

  abstract  = {Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, is recognized as a heterogeneous disease with diverse pathophysiologic mechanisms. In this study, we interrogate the molecular heterogeneity of AD by analyzing 1543 transcriptomes across five brain regions in two AD cohorts using an integrative network approach. We identify three major molecular subtypes of AD corresponding to different combinations of multiple dysregulated pathways, such as susceptibility to tau-mediated neurodegeneration, amyloid-β neuroinflammation, synaptic signaling, immune activity, mitochondria organization, and myelination. Multiscale network analysis reveals subtype-specific drivers such as GABRB2, LRP10, MSN, PLP1, and ATP6V1A We further demonstrate that variations between existing AD mouse models recapitulate a certain degree of subtype heterogeneity, which may partially explain why a vast majority of drugs that succeeded in specific mouse models do not align with generalized human trials across all AD subtypes. Therefore, subtyping patients with AD is a critical step toward precision medicine for this devastating disease.},

Here we estimate the optimal P-threshold (P(optimal)) of a genetic risk score (GRS) for prediction of LOAD in three independent datasets comprising 676 cases and 35,675 family history proxy cases. We show that the discriminative ability of GRS in LOAD prediction is maximised when selecting a small number of SNPs. Both simulation results and direct estimation indicate that the number of causal common SNPs for LOAD may be less than 100, suggesting LOAD is more oligogenic than polygenic. The best GRS explains approximately 75% of SNP-heritability, and individuals in the top decile of GRS have ten-fold increased odds when compared to those in the bottom decile. In addition, 14 variants are identified that contribute to both LOAD risk and age at onset of LOAD.},

As such, the BBB has a close relationship with CNS disease development and treatment, so predicting whether a substance crosses the BBB is a key task in lead discovery for CNS drugs. Machine learning (ML) is a promising strategy for predicting the BBB permeability, but existing studies have been limited by small datasets with limited chemical diversity. To mitigate this issue, we present a large benchmark dataset, B3DB, complied from 50 published resources and categorized based on experimental uncertainty. A subset of the molecules in B3DB has numerical log BB values (1058 compounds), while the whole dataset has categorical (BBB+ or BBB−) BBB permeability labels (7807). The dataset is freely available at https://github.com/theochem/B3DBand https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.15634230.v3(version 3). We also provide some physicochemical properties of the molecules. By analyzing these properties, we can demonstrate some physiochemical similarities and differences between BBB+ and BBB− compounds.},

  abstract = {Abstract This article provides an overview of rank aggregation methods and algorithms, with an emphasis on modern biological applications. Rank aggregation methods have traditionally been used extensively in marketing and advertisement research, and in applied psychology in general. In recent years, rank aggregation methods have emerged as an important tool for combining information from different Internet search engines or from different omics-scale biological studies. We discuss three classes of methods, namely distributional based, heuristic, and stochastic search. The original Thurstone's scaling and its extensions represent the first class of methods that are most appropriate for aggregating many short ranked lists. Aggregating results from consumer rankings of products falls into this category of problems. Its application to biological problems is also being explored. On the other hand, heuristic algorithms and stochastic search methods are applicable to the situation of aggregating a small number of long lists, the so-called ‘high-level’ meta-analysis scenario. Combining results from different search engines/criteria and a number of omics-scale biological applications fall into this category. Heuristic algorithms are deterministic in nature, ranging from simple arithmetic averages of ranks to Markov chains and stationary distributions. Stochastic search algorithms, on the other hand, aim at maximizing a particular criterion such as that following the Kemeny guideline. Several examples will be provided to illustrate, compare, and contrast the methods and algorithms. The examples range from simple and contrive to representing realistic scenarios. In particular, an application to aggregating results from gene expression microarray studies is provided to demonstrate applications of the methods to modern biological problems.

  abstract = {{Motivation: Biologists often employ clustering techniques in the explorative phase of microarray data analysis to discover relevant biological groupings. Given the availability of numerous clustering algorithms in the machine-learning literature, an user might want to select one that performs the best for his/her data set or application. While various validation measures have been proposed over the years to judge the quality of clusters produced by a given clustering algorithm including their biological relevance, unfortunately, a given clustering algorithm can perform poorly under one validation measure while outperforming many other algorithms under another validation measure. A manual synthesis of results from multiple validation measures is nearly impossible in practice, especially, when a large number of clustering algorithms are to be compared using several measures. An automated and objective way of reconciling the rankings is needed.Results: Using a Monte Carlo cross-entropy algorithm, we successfully combine the ranks of a set of clustering algorithms under consideration via a weighted aggregation that optimizes a distance criterion. The proposed weighted rank aggregation allows for a far more objective and automated assessment of clustering results than a simple visual inspection. We illustrate our procedure using one simulated as well as three real gene expression data sets from various platforms where we rank a total of eleven clustering algorithms using a combined examination of 10 different validation measures. The aggregate rankings were found for a given number of clusters k and also for an entire range of k.Availability: R code for all validation measures and rank aggregation is available from the authors upon request.Contact:somnath.datta@louisville.eduSupplementary information: Supplementary information are available at http://www.somnathdatta.org/Supp/RankCluster/supp.htm.}},

Here we describe the transcriptome analysis of 255 primary human microglial samples isolated at autopsy from multiple brain regions of 100 individuals. We performed systematic analyses to investigate various aspects of microglial heterogeneities, including brain region and aging. We mapped expression and splicing quantitative trait loci and showed that many neurological disease susceptibility loci are mediated through gene expression or splicing in microglia. Fine-mapping of these loci nominated candidate causal variants that are within microglia-specific enhancers, finding associations with microglial expression of USP6NL for Alzheimer’s disease and P2RY12 for Parkinson’s disease. We have built the most comprehensive catalog to date of genetic effects on the microglial transcriptome and propose candidate functional variants in neurological and psychiatric disorders.},

Based on retrospective case-control pharmacoepidemiologic analyses of insurance claims data for 7.23 million individuals, we found that sildenafil usage was significantly associated with a 69% reduced risk of AD (hazard ratio 0.31, 95% confidence interval 0.25-0.39, P < 1.0 × 10-8). Propensity score-stratified analyses confirmed that sildenafil is significantly associated with a decreased risk of AD across all four drug cohorts tested (diltiazem, glimepiride, losartan and metformin) after adjusting for age, sex, race and disease comorbidities. We also found that sildenafil increases neurite growth and decreases phospho-tau expression in neuron models derived from induced pluripotent stem cells from patients with AD, supporting mechanistically its potential beneficial effect in AD. The association between sildenafil use and decreased incidence of AD does not establish causality, which will require a randomized controlled trial.},

  abstract  = {The past decades have witnessed a paradigm shift from the traditional drug discovery shaped around the idea of \&ldquo;one target, one disease&rdquo; to polypharmacology (multiple targets, one disease). Given the lack of clear-cut boundaries across disease (endo)phenotypes and genetic heterogeneity across patients, a natural extension to the current polypharmacology paradigm is to target common biological pathways involved in diseases via endopharmacology (multiple targets, multiple diseases). In this study, we present proximal pathway enrichment analysis (PxEA) for pinpointing drugs that target common disease pathways towards network endopharmacology. PxEA uses the topology information of the network of interactions between disease genes, pathway genes, drug targets and other proteins to rank drugs by their interactome-based proximity to pathways shared across multiple diseases, providing unprecedented drug repurposing opportunities. Using PxEA, we show that many drugs indicated for autoimmune disorders are not necessarily specific to the condition of interest, but rather target the common biological pathways across these diseases. Finally, we provide high scoring drug repurposing candidates that can target common mechanisms involved in type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, two conditions that have recently gained attention due to the increased comorbidity among patients.},

  abstract  = {Alzheimer's disease is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder with no cure. Countless promising therapeutics have shown efficacy in rodent Alzheimer's disease models yet failed to benefit human patients. While hope remains that earlier intervention with existing therapeutics will improve outcomes, it is becoming increasingly clear that new approaches to understand and combat the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease are needed. Human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technologies have changed the face of preclinical research and iPSC-derived cell types are being utilized to study an array of human conditions, including neurodegenerative disease. All major brain cell types can now be differentiated from iPSCs, while increasingly complex co-culture systems are being developed to facilitate neuroscience research. Many cellular functions perturbed in Alzheimer's disease can be recapitulated using iPSC-derived cells in vitro, and co-culture platforms are beginning to yield insights into the complex interactions that occur between brain cell types during neurodegeneration. Further, iPSC-based systems and genome editing tools will be critical in understanding the roles of the numerous new genes and mutations found to modify Alzheimer's disease risk in the past decade. While still in their relative infancy, these developing iPSC-based technologies hold considerable promise to push forward efforts to combat Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders.},

  abstract  = {Alzheimer's disease (AD), a dreadful neurodegenerative disorder that affects cognitive and behavioral function in geriatric populations, is characterized by the presence of amyloid deposits and neurofibrillary tangles in brain regions. The International D World Alzheimer Report 2018 noted a global prevalence of 50 million AD cases and forecasted a threefold rise to 139 million by 2050. Although there exist numerous genetic association studies pertinent to AD in different ethnicities, critical genetic factors and signaling pathways underlying its pathogenesis remain ambiguous. This study was aimed to analyze the genetic data retrieved from 32 Gene Expression Omnibus datasets belonging to diverse ethnic cohorts in order to identify overlapping differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Stringent selection criteria were framed to shortlist appropriate datasets based on false discovery rate (FDR) p-value and log FC, and relevant details of upregulated and downregulated DEGs were retrieved. Among the 32 datasets, only six satisfied the selection criteria. The GEO2R tool was employed to retrieve significant DEGs. Nine common DEGs, i.e., SLC5A3, BDNF, SST, SERPINA3, RTN3, RGS4, NPTX, ENC1 and CRYM were found in more than 60% of the selected datasets. These DEGs were later subjected to protein-protein interaction analysis with 18 AD-specific literature-derived genes. Among the nine common DEGs, BDNF, SST, SERPINA3, RTN3 and RGS4 exhibited significant interactions with crucial proteins including BACE1, GRIN2B, APP, APOE, COMT, PSEN1, INS, NEP and MAPT. Functional enrichment analysis revealed involvement of these genes in trans-synaptic signaling, chemical transmission, PI3K pathway signaling, receptor-ligand activity and G protein signaling. These processes are interlinked with AD pathways.},

Nearly half of the protein co-expression modules, including modules significantly altered in AD, were not observed in RNA networks from the same cohorts and brain regions, highlighting the proteopathic nature of AD. Two such AD-associated modules unique to the proteomic network included a module related to MAPK signaling and metabolism and a module related to the matrisome. The matrisome module was influenced by the APOE ε4 allele but was not related to the rate of cognitive decline after adjustment for neuropathology. By contrast, the MAPK/metabolism module was strongly associated with the rate of cognitive decline. Disease-associated modules unique to the proteome are sources of promising therapeutic targets and biomarkers for AD.},

Gene-level association methods such as PrediXcan can prioritize candidate targets. However, limited eQTL sample sizes and absence of relevant developmental and disease context restrict our ability to detect associations. Here we propose an efficient statistical method (MultiXcan) that leverages the substantial sharing of eQTLs across tissues and contexts to improve our ability to identify potential target genes. MultiXcan integrates evidence across multiple panels using multivariate regression, which naturally takes into account the correlation structure. We apply our method to simulated and real traits from the UK Biobank and show that, in realistic settings, we can detect a larger set of significantly associated genes than using each panel separately. To improve applicability, we developed a summary result-based extension called S-MultiXcan, which we show yields highly concordant results with the individual level version when LD is well matched. Our multivariate model-based approach allowed us to use the individual level results as a gold standard to calibrate and develop a robust implementation of the summary-based extension. Results from our analysis as well as software and necessary resources to apply our method are publicly available.},

In this study, a drug-drug network was constructed based on the similarities between their clinical side effects. The indications of a drug may be inferred by the enriched FDA-approved functions of its neighbouring drugs in the network. We systematically screened new indications for 1234 drugs with more than 2 network neighbours, 36.87% of the drugs achieved a performance score of Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain in the top 5 positions (NDCG@5)≥0.7, which means most of the known FDA-approved indications were well predicted at the top 5 positions. In particular, drugs for diabetes, obesity, laxatives and antimycobacterials had extremely high performance with more than 80% of them achieving NDCG@5≥0.7. Additionally, by manually checking the predicted 1858 drug-indication pairs with Expression Analysis Systematic Explorer (EASE) score≤10−5 (EASE score is a rigorously modified Fisher exact test p value), we found that 80.73% of such pairs could be verified by preclinical/clinical studies or scientific literature. Furthermore, our method could be extended to predict drugs not covered in the network. We took 98 external drugs not covered in the network as the test sample set. Based on our similarity criteria using side effects, we identified 41 drugs with significant similarities to other drugs in the network. Among them, 36.59% of the drugs achieved NDCG@5≥0.7. In all of the 106 drug-indication pairs with an EASE score≤0.05, 50.94% of them are supported by FDA approval or preclinical/clinical studies. In summary, our method which is based on the indications enriched by network neighbors may provide new clues for drug repositioning using side effects.},

Strong evidence from clinical and basic research suggests that a major pathway by which APOE4 increases the risk of AD is by driving earlier and more abundant amyloid pathology in the brains of APOE*ε4 carriers. The number of amyloid-β (Aβ)-dependent and Aβ-independent pathways that are known to be differentially modulated by APOE isoforms is increasing. For example, evidence is accumulating that APOE influences tau pathology, tau-mediated neurodegeneration and microglial responses to AD-related pathologies. In addition, APOE4 is either pathogenic or shows reduced efficiency in multiple brain homeostatic pathways, including lipid transport, synaptic integrity and plasticity, glucose metabolism and cerebrovascular function. Here, we review the recent progress in clinical and basic research into the role of APOE in AD pathogenesis. We also discuss how APOE can be targeted for AD therapy using a precision medicine approach.},

  abstract  = {Microarray batch effect (BE) has been the primary bottleneck for large-scale integration of data from multiple experiments. Current BE correction methods either need known batch identities (ComBat) or have the potential to overcorrect, by removing true but unknown biological differences (Surrogate Variable Analysis SVA). It is well known that experimental conditions such as array or reagent batches, PCR amplification or ozone levels can affect the measured expression levels; often the direction of perturbation of the measured expression is the same in different datasets. However, there are no BE correction algorithms that attempt to estimate the individual effects of technical differences and use them to correct expression data. In this manuscript, we show that a set of signatures, each of which is a vector the length of the number of probes, calculated on a reference set of microarray samples can predict much of the batch effect in other validation sets. We present a rationale of selecting a reference set of samples designed to estimate technical differences without removing biological differences. Putting both together, we introduce the Batch Effect Signature Correction (BESC) algorithm that uses the BES calculated on the reference set to efficiently predict and remove BE. Using two independent validation sets, we show that BESC is capable of removing batch effect without removing unknown but true biological differences. Much of the variations due to batch effect is shared between different microarray datasets. That shared information can be used to predict signatures (i.e. directions of perturbation) due to batch effect in new datasets. The correction can be precomputed without using the samples to be corrected (blind), done on each sample individually (single sample) and corrects only known technical effects without removing known or unknown biological differences (conservative). Those three characteristics make it ideal for high-throughput correction of samples for a microarray data repository. We also compare the performance of BESC to three other batch correction methods: SVA, Removing Unwanted Variation (RUV) and Hidden Covariates with Prior (HCP). An R Package besc implementing the algorithm is available from http://explainbio.com.},

We performed a two-stage genome-wide association study totaling 111,326 clinically diagnosed/‘proxy’ AD cases and 677,663 controls. We found 75 risk loci, of which 42 were new at the time of analysis. Pathway enrichment analyses confirmed the involvement of amyloid/tau pathways and highlighted microglia implication. Gene prioritization in the new loci identified 31 genes that were suggestive of new genetically associated processes, including the tumor necrosis factor alpha pathway through the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex. We also built a new genetic risk score associated with the risk of future AD/dementia or progression from mild cognitive impairment to AD/dementia. The improvement in prediction led to a 1.6- to 1.9-fold increase in AD risk from the lowest to the highest decile, in addition to effects of age and the APOE ε4 allele.},

  abstract = {Sporadic late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most frequent cause of dementia associated with aging. Due to the progressive aging of the population, AD is becoming a healthcare burden of unprecedented proportions. Twenty years ago, it was reported that some indole molecules produced by the gut microbiota possess essential biological activities, including neuroprotection and antioxidant properties. Since then, research has cemented additional characteristics of these substances, including anti-inflammatory, immunoregulatory, and amyloid anti-aggregation features. Herein, we summarize the evidence supporting an integrated hypothesis that some of these substances can influence the age of onset and progression of AD and are central to the symbiotic relationship between intestinal microbes and the brain. Studies have shown that some of these substances' activities result from interactions with biologically conserved pathways and with genetic risk factors for AD. By targeting multiple pathologic mechanisms simultaneously, certain indoles may be excellent candidates to ameliorate neurodegeneration. We propose that management of the microbiota to induce a higher production of neuroprotective indoles (e.g., indole propionic acid) will promote brain health during aging. This area of research represents a new therapeutic paradigm that could add functional years of life to individuals who would otherwise develop dementia.},

Little is also known about the roles of apoptosis and autophagy as well as AhR and ER$\alpha$ signaling and HDACs in DIM action. We demonstrated for the first time the strong neuroprotective capacity of DIM in mouse primary hippocampal cell cultures exposed to ischemia at early and later stages of neuronal development. The protective effects of DIM were mediated via inhibition of ischemia-induced apoptosis and autophagy that was accompanied by a decrease in AhR/CYP1A1 signaling and an increase in HDAC activity. DIM decreased the levels of pro-apoptotic factors, i.e., Fas, Caspase-3, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). DIM also reduced the protein levels of autophagy-related Beclin-1 (BECN1) and microtubule-associated proteins 1A/1B light chain (LC3), partially reversed the ischemia-induced decrease in Nucleoporin 62 (NUP62) and inhibited autophagosome formation. In addition, DIM completely reversed the ischemia-induced decrease in histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity in hippocampal neurons. Although DIM inhibited AhR/CYP1A1 signaling, it did not influence the protein expression levels of ER$\alpha$ and ER$\alpha$-regulated CYP19A1 which are known to be controlled by AhR. This study demonstrated for the first time, that the neuroprotective action of 3,3'-diindolylmethane against ischemia involves an inhibition of apoptosis and autophagy and depends on AhR/CYP1A1 signaling and HDAC activity, thus creating the possibility of developing new therapeutic strategies that target neuronal degeneration at specific molecular levels.},

We recently reported that novel 1,1-bis(3′-indolyl)-1-(p-substitutedphenyl)methane (C-DIM) compounds that activate NR4A family nuclear receptors in cancer lines also suppress inflammatory gene expression in primary astrocytes and prevent loss of dopaminergic neurons in mice exposed to 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine and probenecid (MPTPp). In this study, we postulated that the basis for this neuroprotection involves blockade of glial activation and subsequent expression of NF-κB-regulated inflammatory genes. To examine this mechanism, we treated transgenic NF-κB/EGFP reporter mice with MPTPp for 7 days (MPTPp7d) followed by daily oral gavage with either vehicle (corn oil; MPTPp14d) or C-DIMs containing p-methoxyphenyl (C-DIM5), p-hydroxyphenyl (C-DIM8), or p-chlorophenyl (C-DIM12) groups. Each compound conferred significant protection against progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), even when given after 7 days of dosing with MPTPp. C-DIM12 had the greatest neuroprotective activity in MPTPp-treated mice, and was also the most potent compound in suppressing activation of microglia and astrocytes, expression of cytokines and chemokines in quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) array studies, and in reducing expression of NF-κB/EGFP in the SN. C-DIM12 prevented nuclear export of Nurr1 in dopaminergic neurons and enhanced expression of the Nurr1-regulated proteins tyrosine hydroxylase and the dopamine transporter. These data indicate that NR4A-active C-DIM compounds protect against loss of dopamine neurons in the MPTPp model of PD by preventing glial-mediated neuronal injury and by supporting a dopaminergic phenotype in TH-positive neurons in the SNpc.}},

The present studies examined a selected series of para-phenyl{\textendash}substituted diindolylmethane (C-DIM) compounds that display anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective efficacy in vitro. We postulated that the pharmacokinetic behavior of C-DIM compounds after oral administration would correlate with neuroprotective efficacy in vivo in a mouse model of Parkinson{\textquoteright}s disease. Pharmacokinetics and metabolism of 1,1-bis(3'-indolyl)-1-(p-methoxyphenyl)methane (C-DIM5), 1,1-bis(3'-indolyl)-1-(phenyl)methane, 1,1-bis(3'-indolyl)-1-(p-hydroxyphenyl)methane (C-DIM8), and 1,1-bis(3'-indolyl)-1-(p-chlorophenyl)methane (C-DIM12) were determined in plasma and brain of C57Bl/6 mice after oral and intravenous administration at 10 and 1 mg/Kg, respectively. Putative metabolites were measured in plasma, liver, and urine. C-DIM compounds given orally displayed the highest area under the curve, Cmax, and Tmax levels, and C-DIM12 exhibited the most favorable pharmacokinetics of the compounds tested. Oral bioavailability of each compound ranged from 6\% (C-DIM8) to 42\% (C-DIM12). After pharmacokinetic studies, the neuroprotective efficacy of C-DIM5, C-DIM8, and C-DIM12 (50 mg/Kg per oral) was examined in mice exposed to 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) and probenecid for 14 days, a model of progressive neurodegeneration with a strong neuroinflammatory component. C-DIM5 and C-DIM12 given orally once daily after one week of exposure to MPTP and probenecid prevented further loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta and striatal dopamine terminals, indicating that these compounds could be effective therapeutic agents to prevent neurodegeneration.},

  abstract               = {3,3'-Diindolylmethane (DIM), a metabolite of indole-3-carbinol present in Brassicaceae vegetables, possesses various health-promoting effects. Nonetheless, the effect of DIM on neurodegenerative diseases has not been elucidated clearly. In this study, we hypothesized DIM may protect neuronal cells against oxidative stress-induced apoptosis by promoting the formation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and antioxidant enzymes through stabilizing the activation of the tropomyosin-related kinase receptor B (TrkB) cascade and we investigated the effect of DIM on oxidative stress-mediated neurodegenerative models. DIM protected neuronal cells against oxidative stress-induced apoptosis by regulating the expression of apoptosis-related proteins in glutamate-treated HT-22 cells. Additionally, DIM improved the expression of BDNF and antioxidant enzymes, such as heme oxygenase-1, glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit, and NAD(P)H quinine oxidoreductase-1, by promoting the activation of the TrkB/protein kinase B (Akt) pathway in the cells. Consistent with in vitro studies, DIM attenuated memory impairment by protecting hippocampal neuronal cells against oxidative damage in scopolamine-treated mice. Conclusionally, DIM exerted neuroprotective and antioxidant actions through the activation of both BDNF production and antioxidant enzyme formation in accordance with the TrkB/Akt pathway in neuronal cells. Such an effect of DIM may provide information for the application of DIM in the prevention of and therapy for neurodegenerative diseases.},

DIM acts upon several cellular and molecular processes in gastrointestinal cancer cells, including apoptosis, autophagy, invasion, cell cycle regulation, metastasis, angiogenesis, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. In addition, DIM increases the efficacy of other drugs or therapeutic chemicals when used in combinatorial treatment for gastrointestinal cancer. The studies to date offer strong evidence to support the use of DIM as an anticancer and therapeutic agent for gastrointestinal cancer. Therefore, this review provides a comprehensive understanding of the preventive and therapeutic properties of DIM in addition to its different perspective on the safety of DIM in clinical applications for the treatment of gastrointestinal cancers.},

              fibroblast-like synoviocytes (RA-FLSs) exhibit similar
              proliferative features as tumor cells and subsequent erosion to
              cartilage will eventually lead to joint destruction. Therefore,
              it is imperative to search for compounds, which can effectively
              inhibit the abnormal activation of RA-FLSs, and retard RA
              progression.3′3-Diindolylmethane (DIM), the major product of the
              acid-catalyzed oligomerization of indole-3-carbinol from
              cruciferous vegetables, has been reported to be functionally
              relevant to inhibition of migration, invasion and carcinogenesis
              in some solid tumors. In this study, we explored the
              anti-proliferation, anti-metastasis and anti-inflammation
              effects of DIM on RA-FLSs as well as the underlying molecular
              mechanisms. To do this, primary RA-FLSs were isolated from RA
              patients and an animal model. Cell proliferation, migration and
              invasion were measured using CCK-8, scratch, and Transwell
              assays, respectively. The effects of DIM on Matrix
              metalloproteinases (MMPs) and some inflammatory factors mRNA and
              key molecules such as some inflammatory factors and those
              involved in aberrantly-activated signaling pathway in response
              to tumor necrosis factor $\alpha$(TNF-$\alpha$), a typical
              characteristic mediator in RA-FLS, were quantitatively measured
              by real-time PCR and western blotting. Moreover, the effect of
              DIM on adjuvant induced arthritis(AIA) models was evaluated with
              C57BL/6 mice in vivo. The results showed that DIM inhibited
              proliferation, migration and invasion of RA-FLS in vitro.
              Meanwhile, DIM dramatically suppressed TNF-$\alpha$–induced
              increases in the mRNA levels of MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-8, and MMP-9;
              as well as the proinflammatory factors IL-6, IL-8, and IL-1β.
              Mechanistic studies revealed that DIM is able to suppress
              phosphorylated activation not only of p38, JNK in MAPK pathway
              but of AKT, mTOR and downstream molecules in the AKT/mTOR
              pathway. Moreover, DIM treatment decreased expression levels of
              proinflammatory cytokines in the serum and alleviated arthritis
              severity in the knee joints of AIA mice. Taken together, our
              findings demonstrate that DIM could inhibit proliferation,
              migration and invasion of RA-FLSs and reduce proinflammatory
              factors induced by TNF-$\alpha$ in vitro by blocking MAPK and AKT/mTOR pathway and prevent inflammation and knee joint destruction in vivo, which suggests that DIM might have therapeutic potential for RA.},

We report that administration of DIM in a multidose schedule protected rodents against lethal doses of total body irradiation up to 13 Gy, whether DIM dosing was initiated before or up to 24 h after radiation. Physiologic submicromolar concentrations of DIM protected cultured cells against radiation by a unique mechanism: DIM caused rapid activation of ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM), a nuclear kinase that regulates responses to DNA damage (DDR) and oxidative stress. Subsequently, multiple ATM substrates were phosphorylated, suggesting that DIM induces an ATM-dependent DDR-like response, and DIM enhanced radiation-induced ATM signaling and NF-κB activation. DIM also caused activation of ATM in rodent tissues. Activation of ATM by DIM may be due, in part, to inhibition of protein phosphatase 2A, an upstream regulator of ATM. In contrast, DIM did not protect human breast cancer xenograft tumors against radiation under the conditions tested. In tumors, ATM was constitutively phosphorylated and was not further stimulated by radiation and/or DIM. Our findings suggest that DIM is a potent radioprotector and mitigator that functions by stimulating an ATM-driven DDR-like response and NF-κB survival signaling.},

  abstract  = {3,3'-Diindolylmethane (DIM) is a naturally occurring indole, which is currently under investigation as a potential chemopreventive agent. The concentrations of DIM in plasma, liver, kidney, lung, heart, and brain tissues were determined following oral administration of two different formulations to mice (250 mg/kg). Mice were sacrificed periodically from 0 to 24 h after administration of either a crystalline or an absorption-enhanced formulation (Bio-Response-DIM; Indolplex) of DIM, and plasma and tissue concentrations were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (UV detection, 280 nm). A physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model was developed to characterize the pharmacokinetic properties of the two different formulations. The final model included parameters reflecting linear first-order absorption, systemic clearance, and distributional clearance in the remainder compartment, which were considered independent of formulation. All pharmacokinetic profiles from the two formulations were fitted simultaneously to estimate unknown model parameters. Plasma and tissue concentration-time profiles exhibited a rapid rise to peak values at 0.5 to 1 h, followed by a polyexponential decline with an extended terminal phase. These profiles were well described by the final model and unknown parameters were estimated with relatively low coefficients of variation. Relative drug exposure and absorption parameters suggest that BioResponse-DIM exhibited approximately 50\% higher bioavailability than the crystalline formulation. Clearance of DIM was estimated as 7.18 ml/h. This is the first study to characterize the pharmacokinetics of DIM in mice, and the established PBPK model should prove useful in the design and analysis of future preclinical studies aimed at evaluating the in vivo pharmacological effects of DIM.

  abstract           = {BACKGROUND: The potential benefit of cysteamine for Huntington's disease has been demonstrated in HD animal models. Cysteamine and its derivate cystamine were shown to reduce neuropathology and prolong lifespan. Human studies have demonstrated safety, and suggestive results regarding efficacy. Despite all the studies available in vivo, there are only few in vitro studies, and the mechanism of action of cysteamine remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to assess the capacity of cysteamine for neuroprotection against mutant Huntingtin in vitro using cellular models of HD, and to provide initial data regarding mechanism of action. METHODS: We tested the neuroprotective properties of cysteamine in vitro in our primary neuron and iPSC models of HD. RESULTS: Cysteamine showed a strong neuroprotective effect (EC50 = 7.1 nM) against mutant Htt-(aa-1-586 82Q) toxicity, in a nuclear condensation cell toxicity assay. Cysteamine also rescued mitochondrial changes induced by mutant Htt. Modulation of the levels of cysteine or glutathione failed to protect neurons, suggesting that cysteamine neuroprotection is not mediated through cysteine metabolism. Taurine and Hypotaurine, which are metabolites of cysteamine can protect neurons against Htt toxicity, but the inhibition of the enzyme converting cysteamine to hypotaurine does not block either protective activity, suggesting independent protective pathways. Cysteamine has been suggested to activate BDNF secretion; however, cysteamine protection was not blocked by BDNF pathway antagonists. CONCLUSIONS: Cysteamine was strongly neuroprotective with relatively high potency. We demonstrated that the main neuroprotective pathways that have been proposed to be the mechanism of protection by cysteamine can all be blocked and still not prevent the neuroprotective effect. The results suggest the involvement of other yet-to-be-determined neuroprotective pathways.},

There is therefore an urgent need to identify and/or develop therapeutic strategies that will demonstrate ‘disease modifying’ capacities. The molecule cystamine, and its reduced form cysteamine, act via a number of pathways determined to be critical to the pathogenesis of PD. In particular, cystamine is capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier, and both agents (cystamine and cysteamine) can promote the secretion of neurotrophic factors, inhibit oxidative stress, reduce inflammatory responses and importantly, have already been trialed in humans for a number of other clinical indications. In the last decade, our laboratory has accumulated compelling evidence that both cystamine and cysteamine can halt, and even reverse, ongoing neurodegenerative processes in a number of different models of PD, and as such, should now be taken forward to clinical trials in PD.},

To evaluate the possible role of RGS4 in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia, we conducted genetic association and linkage studies using samples ascertained independently in Pittsburgh and New Delhi and by the NIMH Collaborative Genetics Initiative. Using the transmission disequilibrium test, significant transmission distortion was observed in the Pittsburgh and NIMH samples. Among single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) spanning approximately 300 kb, significant associations involved four SNPs localized to a 10 kb region at RGS4 , but the associated haplotypes differed. A trend for transmission distortion was also present in the Indian sample for haplotypes incorporating the same SNPs. Consistent with the linkage/association observed from the family-based tests, samples with affected siblings (NIMH, India) showed higher levels of allele sharing, identical by descent, at RGS4 . When the US patients were contrasted to two population-based control samples, however, no significant differences were observed. To check the specificity of the transmission bias, we therefore examined US families with bipolar I disorder (BD1) probands. This sample also showed a trend for transmission distortion, and differed significantly from the population-based controls for the four-SNP haplotypes tested in the other samples. The transmission distortion is unlikely to be due to chance, but its mechanism and specificity require further study. Our results illustrate the potential power of combining gene expression profiling and genomic analyses to identify susceptibility genes for genetically complex disorders. }},

  abstract = {Huntington's disease (HD) is an untreatable neurological disorder caused by selective and progressive degeneration of the caudate nucleus and putamen of the basal ganglia. Although the etiology of HD pathology is not fully understood, the observed loss of neuronal cells is thought to occur primarily through apoptosis. Furthermore, there is evidence in HD that cell death is mediated through mitochondrial pathways, and mitochondrial deficits are commonly associated with HD. We have previously reported that treatment with tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), a hydrophilic bile acid, prevented neuropathology and associated behavioral deficits in the 3-nitropropionic acid rat model of HD. We therefore examined whether TUDCA would also be neuroprotective in a genetic mouse model of HD. Our results showed that systemically administered TUDCA led to a significant reduction in striatal neuropathology of the R6/2 transgenic HD mouse. Specifically, R6/2 mice began receiving TUDCA at 6 weeks of age and exhibited reduced striatal atrophy, decreased striatal apoptosis, as well as fewer and smaller size ubiquitinated neuronal intranuclear huntingtin inclusions. Moreover, locomotor and sensorimotor deficits were significantly improved in the TUDCA-treated mice. In conclusion, TUDCA is a nontoxic, endogenously produced hydrophilic bile acid that is neuroprotective in a transgenic mouse model of HD and, therefore, may provide a novel and effective treatment in patients with HD.},

A targeted metabolomic analysis of primary and secondary bile acids measured from post-mortem brain samples of 111 individuals supports these results. Our metabolic network analysis suggests that taurine transport, bile acid synthesis, and cholesterol metabolism differ in AD and cognitively normal individuals. We also identify putative transcription factors regulating metabolic genes and influencing altered metabolism in AD. Intriguingly, some bile acids measured in brain tissue cannot be explained by the presence of enzymes responsible for their synthesis, suggesting that they may originate from the gut microbiome and are transported to the brain.

  abstract = {Current medications for neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Huntington's disease (HD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and Schizophrenia mainly target disease symptoms. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop novel therapeutics that can delay, halt or reverse disease progression. AD, HD, PD, and schizophrenia are characterized by elevated oxidative and nitrosative stress, which play a central role in pathogenesis. Clinical trials utilizing antioxidants to counter disease progression have largely been unsuccessful. Most antioxidants are relatively non-specific and do not adequately target neuroprotective pathways. Accordingly, a search for agents that restore redox balance as well as halt or reverse neuronal loss is underway. The small molecules, cysteamine, the decarboxylated derivative of the amino acid cysteine, and cystamine, the oxidized form of cysteamine, respectively, mitigate oxidative stress and inflammation and upregulate neuroprotective pathways involving brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling. Cysteamine can traverse the blood brain barrier, a desirable characteristic of drugs targeting neurodegeneration. This review addresses recent developments in the use of these aminothiols to counter neurodegeneration and neuropsychiatric deficits.},

Abstract Cystamine has shown significant neuroprotective properties in preclinical studies of Parkinson’s disease (PD) and Huntington’s disease (HD). Cysteamine, its FDA-approved reduced form, is scheduled to be tested for clinical efficacy in HD patients. Here, we studied the key cystamine metabolites, namely cysteamine, hypotaurine and taurine, as well as cysteine, in order to identify which one is more distinctively responsible for the neuroprotective action of cystamine. After a single administration of cystamine (10, 50 or 200 mg/kg), naïve mice were perfused with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 1, 3, 12, 24 or 48 h post-injection and brain and plasma samples were analyzed by two distinct HPLC methods. Although plasma levels remained under the detection threshold, significant increases in cysteamine brain levels were detected with the 50 and 200 mg/kg doses in mice perfused 1 and 3 h following cystamine injection. To further assess cysteamine as the candidate molecule for pre-clinical and clinical trials in PD, we evaluated its capacity to cross the blood brain barrier. Using an in situ cerebral perfusion technique, we determined that the brain transport coefficient (Clup) of cysteamine (259 μM) was 0.15 ± 0.02 μL/g/s and was increased up to 0.34 ± 0.07 μL/g/s when co-perfused in the presence of cysteine. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that cysteamine is the neuroactive metabolite of cystamine and may further support its therapeutic use in neurodegenerative diseases, particularly in HD and PD.},

We found that LPS treatment leads to sickness behavior and cognitive impairment in mice as shown in the Morris water maze and passive avoidance test, and these effects were accompanied by microglia activation (labeled by ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule-1, IBA-1) and neuronal cell loss (labeled by microtubule-associated protein 2, MAP-2) in the hippocampus. The levels of interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) in the serum and brain homogenates were reduced by the LPS treatment, while the levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and nitric oxide (NO) were increased. In addition, LPS promoted the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in the brain homogenates. The Western blot analysis showed that the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway was activated in the LPS groups. Furthermore, VIPER, which is a TLR-4-specific inhibitory peptide, prevented the LPS-induced neuroinflammation and cognitive impairment. These data suggest that LPS induced cognitive impairment and neuroinflammation via microglia activation by activating the NF-kB signaling pathway; furthermore, we compared the time points, doses, methods and outcomes of LPS administration between intraperitoneal and intracerebroventricular injections of LPS in LPS-induced neuroinflammation and cognitive impairment, and these data may provide additional insight for researchers performing neuroinflammation research.},

In pathological settings, mostly in lung and breast cancer and in glioblastoma, the EGFR is a driver of tumorigenesis. Inappropriate activation of the EGFR in cancer mainly results from amplification and point mutations at the genomic locus, but transcriptional upregulation or ligand overproduction due to autocrine/paracrine mechanisms has also been described. Moreover, the EGFR is increasingly recognized as a biomarker of resistance in tumors, as its amplification or secondary mutations have been found to arise under drug pressure. This evidence, in addition to the prominent function that this receptor plays in normal epithelia, has prompted intense investigations into the role of the EGFR both at physiological and at pathological level. Despite the large body of knowledge obtained over the last two decades, previously unrecognized (herein defined as 'noncanonical') functions of the EGFR are currently emerging. Here, we will initially review the canonical ligand-induced EGFR signaling pathway, with particular emphasis to its regulation by endocytosis and subversion in human tumors. We will then focus on the most recent advances in uncovering noncanonical EGFR functions in stress-induced trafficking, autophagy, and energy metabolism, with a perspective on future therapeutic applications.},

  abstract = {PKCα variants in some patients with Alzheimer’s disease may mediate the pathological effects of amyloid-β. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by neurodegeneration and impaired neuronal function in the brain that lead to progressive cognitive loss. The early-onset form of AD is linked to genetic mutations, and accumulation of a protein called amyloid-β occurs in many patients with both early- and late-onset AD. By examining the genetics of a large cohort of families in which late-onset AD was diagnosed, Alfonso et al. found that activating mutations in protein kinase Cα (PKCα) correlated with the disease. Pharmacologically inhibiting PKCα or deleting the gene encoding it prevented amyloid-β from impairing synaptic activity in hippocampal tissue slices from mice. This study suggests that PKCα variants mediate the pathological effects of amyloid-β in some patients with late-onset AD. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive dementia disorder characterized by synaptic degeneration and amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulation in the brain. Through whole-genome sequencing of 1345 individuals from 410 families with late-onset AD (LOAD), we identified three highly penetrant variants in PRKCA, the gene that encodes protein kinase Cα (PKCα), in five of the families. All three variants linked with LOAD displayed increased catalytic activity relative to wild-type PKCα as assessed in live-cell imaging experiments using a genetically encoded PKC activity reporter. Deleting PRKCA in mice or adding PKC antagonists to mouse hippocampal slices infected with a virus expressing the Aβ precursor CT100 revealed that PKCα was required for the reduced synaptic activity caused by Aβ. In PRKCA−/− neurons expressing CT100, introduction of PKCα, but not PKCα lacking a PDZ interaction moiety, rescued synaptic depression, suggesting that a scaffolding interaction bringing PKCα to the synapse is required for its mediation of the effects of Aβ. Thus, enhanced PKCα activity may contribute to AD, possibly by mediating the actions of Aβ on synapses. In contrast, reduced PKCα activity is implicated in cancer. Hence, these findings reinforce the importance of maintaining a careful balance in the activity of this enzyme.},

  abstract = {Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive neuronal cell loss. Recently, dysregulation of intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis has been suggested as a common proximal cause of neural dysfunction in AD. Here, we investigated (1) the pathogenic role of destabilization of ryanodine receptor (RyR2) in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) upon development of AD phenotypes in AppNL-G-F mice, which harbor three familial AD mutations (Swedish, Beyreuther/Iberian, and Arctic), and (2) the therapeutic effect of enhanced calmodulin (CaM) binding to RyR2. In the neuronal cells from AppNL-G-F mice, CaM dissociation from RyR2 was associated with AD-related phenotypes, i.e. Aβ accumulation, TAU phosphorylation, ER stress, neuronal cell loss, and cognitive dysfunction. Surprisingly, either genetic (by V3599K substitution in RyR2) or pharmacological (by dantrolene) enhancement of CaM binding to RyR2 reversed almost completely the aforementioned AD-related phenotypes, except for Aβ accumulation. Thus, destabilization of RyR2 due to CaM dissociation is most likely an early and fundamental pathogenic mechanism involved in the development of AD. The discovery that neuronal cell loss can be fully prevented simply by stabilizing RyR2 sheds new light on the treatment of AD.},

SCA48 is characterized by an ataxic movement disorder that is often, but not always, accompanied by a cognitive affective syndrome. We report a severe early onset dementia syndrome that mimics frontotemporal dementia and is caused by the intronic splice donor variant c.524+1G>A in STUB1. Impaired splicing was demonstrated by RNA analysis and in minigene assays of mutated and wild-type constructs of STUB1. The most striking consequence of this splicing impairment was retention of intron 3 in STUB1, which led to an in-frame insertion of 63 amino acids (aa) (p.Arg175_Glu176ins63) into the highly conserved coiled-coil domain of its encoded protein, C-terminus of HSP70-interacting protein (CHIP). To a lesser extent, activation of two cryptic splice sites in intron 3 was observed. The almost exclusively used one, c.524+86, was not predicted by in silico programs. Variant c.524+86 caused a frameshift (p.Arg175fs*93) that resulted in a truncated protein and presumably impairs the C-terminal U-box of CHIP, which normally functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. The cryptic splice site c.524+99 was rarely used and led to an in-frame insertion of 33 aa (p.Arg175_Glu176ins33) that resulted in disruption of the coiled-coil domain, as has been previously postulated for complete intron 3 retention. We additionally detected repeat expansions in the range of reduced penetrance in the TATA box-binding protein (TBP) gene by excluding other genes associated with dementia syndromes. The repeat expansion was heterozygous in one patient but compound heterozygous in the more severely affected patient. Therefore, we concluded that the observed severe dementia syndrome has a digenic background, making STUB1 and TBP important candidate genes responsible for early onset dementia syndromes.},

Several recent studies of our laboratory and other groups have highlighted the beneficial role of CHIP in the pathogenesis of several neurological diseases. The objective of this review is to discuss the possible molecular mechanisms that contribute to the pathogenesis of neurological diseases in which CHIP has a pivotal role, such as stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and polyglutamine diseases; furthermore, CHIP mutations could also cause neurodegenerative diseases. Based on the available literature, CHIP overexpression could serve as a promising therapeutic target for several neurological diseases.},

  abstract = {APOE4 is the strongest genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease1-3. However, the effects of APOE4 on the human brain are not fully understood, limiting opportunities to develop targeted therapeutics for individuals carrying APOE4 and other risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease4-8. Here, to gain more comprehensive insights into the impact of APOE4 on the human brain, we performed single-cell transcriptomics profiling of post-mortem human brains from APOE4 carriers compared with non-carriers. This revealed that APOE4 is associated with widespread gene expression changes across all cell types of the human brain. Consistent with the biological function of APOE2-6, APOE4 significantly altered signalling pathways associated with cholesterol homeostasis and transport. Confirming these findings with histological and lipidomic analysis of the post-mortem human brain, induced pluripotent stem-cell-derived cells and targeted-replacement mice, we show that cholesterol is aberrantly deposited in oligodendrocytes--myelinating cells that are responsible for insulating and promoting the electrical activity of neurons. We show that altered cholesterol localization in the APOE4 brain coincides with reduced myelination. Pharmacologically facilitating cholesterol transport increases axonal myelination and improves learning and memory in APOE4 mice. We provide a single-cell atlas describing the transcriptional effects of APOE4 on the aging human brain and establish a functional link between APOE4, cholesterol, myelination and memory, offering therapeutic opportunities for Alzheimer’s disease.},

Both of them are also the top therapeutic targets for disease treatment. The discovery of the cross-talk between GPCRs and RTKs connects these two vast signaling networks and complicates the already complicated signaling networks that regulate cell signaling and function. In this review, we focus on the transactivation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a subfamily of RTKs, by GPCRs. Since the first report of EGFR transactivation by GPCR, significant progress has been made including the elucidation of the mechanisms underlying the transactivation. Here, we first provide a basic picture for GPCR, EGFR and EGFR transactivation by GPCR. We then discuss the progress made in the last five years and finally provided our view of the future challenge and future researches needed to overcome these challenges.},

  abstract               = {The Alzheimer's disease (AD) afflicted brain is neuropathologically defined by extracellular amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated tau protein. However, accumulating evidence suggests that the presynaptic protein α-synuclein (αSyn), mainly associated with synucleinopathies like Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and multiple system atrophy (MSA), is involved in the pathophysiology of AD. Lewy-related pathology (LRP), primarily comprised of αSyn, is present in a majority of autopsied AD brains, and higher levels of αSyn in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD have been linked to cognitive decline. Recent studies also suggest that the asymptomatic accumulation of Aβ plaques is associated with higher CSF αSyn levels in subjects at risk of sporadic AD and in individuals carrying autosomal dominant AD mutations. Experimental evidence has further linked αSyn mainly to tau hyperphosphorylation, but also to the pathological actions of Aβ and the APOEε4 allele, the latter being a major genetic risk factor for both AD and DLB. In this review, we provide a summary of the current evidence proposing an involvement of αSyn either as an active or passive player in the pathophysiological ensemble of AD, and furthermore describe in detail the current knowledge of αSyn structure and inferred function.},

  abstract = {To define metrics of phenotypic aging, it is essential to identify biological and environmental factors that influence the pace of aging. Previous attempts to develop aging metrics were hampered by cross-sectional designs and/or focused on younger populations. In the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA), we collected longitudinally across the adult age range a comprehensive list of phenotypes within four domains (body composition, energetics, homeostatic mechanisms and neurodegeneration/neuroplasticity) and functional outcomes. We integrated individual deviations from population trajectories into a global longitudinal phenotypic metric of aging and demonstrate that accelerated longitudinal phenotypic aging is associated with faster physical and cognitive decline, faster accumulation of multimorbidity and shorter survival. These associations are more robust compared with the use of phenotypic and epigenetic measurements at a single time point. Estimation of these metrics required repeated measures of multiple phenotypes over time but may uniquely facilitate the identification of mechanisms driving phenotypic aging and subsequent age-related functional decline.},

  abstract = {Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a heterogeneous disorder with abnormalities in multiple biological domains. In an advanced machine learning analysis of postmortem brain and in vivo blood multi-omics molecular data (N = 1863), we integrated epigenomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic profiles into a multilevel biological AD taxonomy. We obtained a personalized multilevel molecular index of AD dementia progression that predicts severity of neuropathologies, and identified three robust molecular-based subtypes that explain much of the pathologic and clinical heterogeneity of AD. These subtypes present distinct patterns of alteration in DNA methylation, RNA, proteins, and metabolites, identifiable in the brain and subsequently in blood. In addition, the genetic variations that predispose to the various AD subtypes in brain predict distinct spatial patterns of alteration in cell types, suggesting a unique influence of each putative AD variant on neuropathological mechanisms. These observations support that an individually tailored multi-omics molecular taxonomy of AD may represent distinct targets for preventive or treatment interventions. Integration of multilayer molecular data provides a robust assessment and classification of the Alzheimer’s disease spectrum.},
