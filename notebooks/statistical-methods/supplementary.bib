  abstract         = {Lipid droplets are considered to be the hub for storage and metabolism of cellular lipids. In previous work we have phenotyped the lipidome of murine hepatocyte lipid droplets using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS) plus integrated MS/MS, followed by automatic analysis of the MS data. The organelles were isolated after intervention studies involving nutritional stress (extended feeding of a high fat diet or short term fasting), genetic stress due to knock-out of adipocyte triglyceride lipase, or by combined application of nutritional and genetic stress together (‘super stress’). Lipidomics at the level of lipid species (profiling of lipid classes) and lipid molecular species (structural analysis in parallel) has unraveled clear lipid droplet phenotypes as judged by patterns seen best in triacylglycerol (TG) lipidomes, but also in diacylglycerol and phosphatidylcholine lipidomes. The combined view of these data presented here validates the methods used and provides high quality lipidomic data for further bioinformatic inspections. Examples are given for identification of TG species subsets considered surrogates for whole TG lipidomes.},

Lipids play critical roles in energy homeostasis, membrane structure, and signaling. Using liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry, we provide a comprehensive semiquantification of lipids during the life cycle of Drosophila melanogaster (230 glycerophospholipids, 210 sphingolipids, 6 sterols and sterol esters, and 60 glycerolipids) and obtain biological insights through this biochemical resource. First, we find a high and constant triacylglycerol-to-membrane lipid ratio during pupal stage, which is nonobvious in the absence of nutrient uptake and tissue remodeling. Second, sphingolipids undergo specific changes in headgroup (glycosylation) and tail configurations (unsaturation and hydroxylation on sphingoid base and fatty acyls, respectively), which correlate with gene expression of known (GlcT/CG6437; FA2H/ CG30502) and putative (Cyt-b5-r/CG13279) enzymes. Third, we identify a gender bias in phosphoethanolamine-ceramides as a lead for future investigation into sexual maturation. Finally, we partially characterize ghiberti, required for male meiotic cytokinesis, as a homolog of mammalian serine palmitoyltransferase.},

  abstract         = {Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease whose pathological hallmark is the accumulation of intracellular α-synuclein aggregates in Lewy bodies. Lipid metabolism dysregulation may play a significant role in PD pathogenesis; however, large plasma lipidomic studies in PD are lacking. In the current study, we analyzed the lipidomic profile of plasma obtained from 150 idiopathic PD patients and 100 controls, taken from the ‘Spot’ study at Columbia University Medical Center in New York. Our mass spectrometry based analytical panel consisted of 520 lipid species from 39 lipid subclasses including all major classes of glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids, glycerolipids and sterols. Each lipid species was analyzed using a logistic regression model. The plasma concentrations of two lipid subclasses, triglycerides and monosialodihexosylganglioside (GM3), were different between PD and control participants. GM3 ganglioside concentration had the most significant difference between PD and controls (1.531±0.037 pmol/μl versus 1.337±0.040 pmol/μl respectively; p-value = 5.96E-04; q-value = 0.048; when normalized to total lipid: p-value = 2.890E-05; q-value = 2.933E-03). Next, we used a collection of 20 GM3 and glucosylceramide (GlcCer) species concentrations normalized to total lipid to perform a ROC curve analysis, and found that these lipids compare favorably with biomarkers reported in previous studies (AUC = 0.742 for males, AUC = 0.644 for females). Our results suggest that higher plasma GM3 levels are associated with PD. GM3 lies in the same glycosphingolipid metabolic pathway as GlcCer, a substrate of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase, which has been associated with PD. These findings are consistent with previous reports implicating lower glucocerebrosidase activity with PD risk.},

abstract = {Lipids are key regulators of brain function and have been increasingly implicated in neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer disease (AD). Here, a systems-based approach was employed to determine the lipidome of brain tissues affected by AD. Specifically, we used liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to profile extracts from the prefrontal cortex, entorhinal cortex, and cerebellum of late-onset AD (LOAD) patients, as well as the forebrain of three transgenic familial AD (FAD) mouse models. Although the cerebellum lacked major alterations in lipid composition, we found an elevation of a signaling pool of diacylglycerol as well as sphingolipids in the prefrontal cortex of AD patients. Furthermore, the diseased entorhinal cortex showed specific enrichment of lysobisphosphatidic acid, sphingomyelin, the ganglioside GM3, and cholesterol esters, all of which suggest common pathogenic mechanisms associated with endolysosomal storage disorders. Importantly, a significant increase in cholesterol esters and GM3 was recapitulated in the transgenic FAD models, suggesting that these mice are relevant tools to study aberrant lipid metabolism of endolysosomal dysfunction associated with AD. Finally, genetic ablation of phospholipase D2, which rescues the synaptic and behavioral deficits of an FAD mouse model, fully normalizes GM3 levels. These data thus unmask a cross-talk between the metabolism of phosphatidic acid, the product of phospholipase D2, and gangliosides, and point to a central role of ganglioside anomalies in AD pathogenesis. Overall, our study highlights the hypothesis generating potential of lipidomics and identifies novel region-specific lipid anomalies potentially linked to AD pathogenesis.}
