 abstract = {Abstract Introduction Comorbidity with metabolic diseases indicates that lipid metabolism plays a role in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Comprehensive lipidomic analysis can provide new insights into the altered lipid metabolism in AD. Method In this study, a total 349 serum lipids were measured in 806 participants enrolled in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative Phase 1 cohort and analyzed using lipid-set enrichment statistics, a data mining method to find coregulated lipid sets. Results We found that sets of blood lipids were associated with current AD biomarkers and with AD clinical symptoms. AD diagnosis was associated with 7 of 28 lipid sets of which four also correlated with cognitive decline, including polyunsaturated fatty acids. Cerebrospinal fluid amyloid beta (Aβ1-42) correlated with glucosylceramides, lysophosphatidylcholines and unsaturated triacylglycerides; cerebrospinal fluid total tau and brain atrophy correlated with monounsaturated sphingomyelins and ceramides, in addition to EPA-containing lipids. Discussion AD-associated lipid sets indicated that lipid desaturation, elongation, and acyl chain remodeling processes are disturbed in AD subjects. Monounsaturated lipid metabolism was important in early stages of AD, whereas the polyunsaturated lipid metabolism was associated with later stages of AD. Our study provides several new hypotheses for studying the role of lipid metabolism in AD.},

 abstract = {Progress toward the development of efficacious therapies for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is halted by a lack of understanding early underlying pathological mechanisms. Systems biology encompasses several techniques including genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics. Metabolomics is the newest omics platform that offers great potential for the diagnosis and prognosis of neurodegenerative diseases as an individual's metabolome reflects alterations in genetic, transcript, and protein profiles and influences from the environment. Advancements in the field of metabolomics have demonstrated the complexity of dynamic changes associated with AD progression underscoring challenges with the development of efficacious therapeutic interventions. Defining systems-level alterations in AD could provide insights into disease mechanisms, reveal sex-specific changes, advance the development of biomarker panels, and aid in monitoring therapeutic efficacy, which should advance individualized medicine. Since metabolic pathways are largely conserved between species, metabolomics could improve the translation of preclinical research conducted in animal models of AD into humans. A summary of recent developments in the application of metabolomics to advance the AD field is provided below.},
