\section{Lipidomics}

The 593 lipid species are classified into 34 lipid groups. 
Lipid extracts were prepared from tissue homogenates spiked with multiple
class-based internal standards using a modified Bligh and Dyer method, and
they were analyzed on a platform comprising of Agilent 1260 Infinity HPLC
integrated to Agilent 6490A QQQ mass spectrometer controlled by Masshunter v
7.0 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Glycerophospholipids and
sphingolipids were separated with normal-phase HPLC as described previously25,
with a few modifications. An Agilent Zorbax Rx-Sil column (2.1 x 100 mm, 1.8
$\mu$m) maintained at $25\circ$C was used under the following conditions: mobile phase A
(chloroform: methanol: ammonium hydroxide, 89.9:10:0.1, v/v) and mobile phase
B (chloroform: methanol: water: ammonium hydroxide, 55:39:5.9:0.1, v/v); 95\% A
for 2 min, decreased linearly to 30\% A over 18 min and further decreased to
25\% A over 3 min, before returning to 95\% A over 2 min and held for 6 min.
Separation of sterols and glycerolipids was carried out on a reverse phase
Agilent Zorbax Eclipse XDB-C18 column (4.6 x 100 mm, 3.5um) using an isocratic
mobile phase, chloroform, methanol, and 0.1 M ammonium acetate (25:25:1) at a
flow rate of 300 $\mu$l/min.
Quantification of lipid species was accomplished using multiple reaction
monitoring (MRM) transitions25 under both positive and negative ionization
modes in conjunction with referencing of class-based internal standards: PA
14:0/14:0, PC 14:0/14:0, PE 14:0/14:0, phosphatidylglycerol (PG) 15:0/15:0,
phosphatidylinositol (PI)17:0-20:4; phosphatidylserine (PS) 14:0/14:0, BMP
14:0/14:0, Hemi BMP 14:0; LPC 13:0,  LPE 14:0, LPI 13:0, Cer d18:1/17:0, SM
d18:1/12:0, dhSM d18:0/12:0, GalCer d18:1/12:0, sulfatide (Sulf) d18:1/12:0,
LacCer d18:1/12:0, D7-cholesterol, CE 17:0, MG 17:0, DG 28:0/14:0 D5-TG
16:0/18:0/16:0 (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL). 

Multiple class-based internal standards of similar ionization efficiencies
were selected and spiked at an appropriate concentration
(0.05-156.14pmol/$\mu$l) as published elsewhere~\citep{Chan2017}. Each
internal standard was later used to calculate the concentrations of
corresponding lipid classes by first calculating ratio between measured
intensities of a lipid species and that of corresponding internal standard
multiplied by the known concentration of the internal standard.

Relative molar amounts of lipid species in each sample were calculated based
on appropriate class-based internal standards and normalized against tissue
wet weight (nmol/ug). The data were then normalized to the sum of these molar
contributions to obtain comparable relative contributions of each lipid
species or class and expressed as mol\% relative to total amount of all
measured lipid classes~\citep{Hartler2014,Guan2013}.

\section{Data overview}

Our lipidomic assay quantified the level of 593 lipid species in three brain
regions (DLPFC, CN and Putamen) from each of $n=10$ subjects (6 control and 4
ChAc).  Besides ChAc status (Dx variable), we knew the age at each subject's
death (AgeAtDeath variable).

The 593 lipid species were classified into 34 lipid groups based on chemical
structure.  The smallest group (FC, free cholesterol group) had only one
species; for the rest of the groups, the number $n_g$ of lipid species ranged
from 6 (NSer, N-acyl serine group) to 42 (TG, tryacylglycerol group).

Given $3n = 30$ observations and 593 lipid species, we refer to the $30 \times
593$ matrix of lipid levels as \emph{species-level data} and we based our
final inferences on these data.  Given 34 lipid groups, we also produced a
smaller, $30 \times 34$ data matrix by summing the level of lipid species
within groups; we call this matrix \emph{group-level data} and we used it only
for preliminary analyses.

Note that in the species-level data we have $30 \times n_g$ observations on
each group $g$ but in the group-level data only $30$ observations on each
group.  The number of observations on each lipid species in the species-level
data is also only $30$.  Therefore, making inferences on lipid groups based on
the species-level data comes with the advantage of $n_g \times$ more
observations relative to making inferences (i) on groups based on the
group-level data or (ii) on species based on the species-level data.

According to the central limit theorem the $n_g \times$ more observations,
under certain conditions (see below), may afford $\approx \sqrt n_g \times$
reduction of error.  This is the most beneficial for large lipid groups.  For
instance, the $g = \mathrm{PC}$ (phosphatidylcholine) group contains $n_g =
25$ species, which means ideally $\approx 5 \times$ reduction in error.

The aforementioned advantage of $n_g \times$
more observation on lipid group $g$ based on the species-level data depends
entirely on the assumption that the level of species $c$ is conditionally
i.i.d across all $c \in g$ for a given ChAc status, brain region and age at
death.  We confirmed this assumption using heatmaps of a standardized  version
of the species-level data.  Standardization proved to be essential because
lipid level typically varies greatly across all species $c \in g$.

\section{Data standardization}

We standardized lipid levels for the sake of all visualizations (all heatmaps
and Fig.~\ref{fig:individual-changes}-\ref{fig:individual-changes-simple}) and
all model-based
statistical inference.  In the species-level data, for each lipid species $c$,
we standardized lipid levels $z_{ci}$ across the $i = 1...30$ samples to
obtain the standardized levels $\{y_{ci}\;:\; i = 1...30\}$:
\begin{equation}
	y_{ci} = (z_{ci} - \bar{z}_c) / s_c,
\end{equation}

where $\bar{z}_c = 30^{-1} \sum_{i=1}^{30} z_{ci}$ is the average level of
species $c$ and $s^2_c = (30 - 1)^{-1} \sum_{i=1}^{30} (z_{ci} - \bar{z}_c)^2$
is the corresponding sample variance.  After standardization the unit of lipid
level change is the sample standard deviation $s_c$.

We performed similar standardization also on the group-level data.

\section{Regression model}

For each lipid group $g$ we modeled standardized lipid level using linear
regression with the symbolic formula `Level $\sim$ 1 + Region + Dx:Region +
AgeAtDeath`.  This means that we regressed standardized lipid level (Level) on
a linear combination of fixed effects terms: brain region (Region), the
combination of region and ChAc status (Dx:Region, the interaction term of our
main interest), and on the age at death (AgeAtDeath).  In addition, we added a
random effects term that modeled subject-to-subject heterogeneity of lipid
levels.

Therefore our model could be written as
\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{y}_{g} = \sum_{j=0}^{6} \beta_{gj} \mathbf{x}_{gj} + \mathbf{\gamma}_{g} + \mathbf{\epsilon}_{g},
	\label{eq:main-model}
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{y}_{g}$ is the $m$-length data vector of standardized lipid
level from $m$ observations, where $m = 30 n_g$ for the species-level data and
$m = 30$ for the group-level data; $\{\mathbf{x}_{gj}\}_j$ are $m$-length
data vectors as defined in the Table~\ref{tab:data-vectors};
$\mathbf{\gamma}_{g}$ and $\mathbf{\epsilon}_{g}$ are both random $m$-vectors
such that
$\mathbf{\gamma}_{g} \sim \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{0}_m, \sigma^2_{\gamma
g}\Omega_g)$ and
$\mathbf{\epsilon}_{g} \sim \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{0}_m, \sigma^2_{\epsilon g}
\mathbf{I}_m)$, respectively.  Here $\Omega$ is the $m \times m$ correlation
matrix of $\mathbf{\gamma}_{g}$ constrained such that all observations from
the same subject change by the same random amount (they have a correlation of
one between each other), while observations from different subjects are
independent from each other (they have zero correlation).

\label{tab:parameters}
\end{table}

We also fitted a more complex model that contains, as covariate, the
post-mortem interval in hours (PMI); with symbolic formula the model is
written as `Level $\sim$ 1 + Region + Dx:Region + AgeAtDeath + PMI`.  We found
that PMI had non-significant effect ($\alpha=0.01$) on lipid levels
(Fig.~S\ref{fig:PMI-pvals}) and the key results were little affected by the
correction for PMI
(Fig.~S\ref{fig:PMI-effect-on-estimates},~S\ref{fig:pvalues-corrected-wo-PMI}).
Therefore, in the main text we present results based on the simpler model that
lacks PMI correction.

\section{Model fitting}

We fitted models with the statsmodels Python package.  Goodness of fit was
confirmed using the Jarque-Bera test and normal Q-Q plots of
residuals.

\section{Hypothesis testing}

For each lipid group $g$ we formulated our inference on ChAc-associated lipid
changes using estimates $\hat{\beta}_{3g}, \hat{\beta}_{4g},
\hat{\beta}_{5g}$, which quantify the change of lipid level in ChAc w.r.t
Control in the DLPFC, CN and Putamen regions, respectively.

We also tested each of the following three null hypotheses: $\beta_{3g} = 0$,
$\beta_{4g} = 0$ and $\beta_{5g} = 0$ meaning no change in lipid group $g$'s
level in ChAc w.r.t Control in the DLPFC, CN and Putamen, respectively.
Testing for all 34 lipid groups resulted in $34 \times 3 = 102$ p-values.
We performed multiple hypothesis test correction conservatively taking all 102
p-values into account.  We performed both the Bonferroni and the
Benjamini-Hochberg procedures, and report in Results, for any given region,
those lipid groups for which the null hypothesis was rejected by the
Benjamini-Hochberg procedure.
